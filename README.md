# VIMessages
The project VIMessages aims at creating an android-based application which stores any selected SMS in the SQLite database of the phone.
The messages can be viewed in the application. Even upon deletion of SMS from the inbox of default messaging application, they are 
still stored in the database of the phone. Also a feature of security is introduced through sign-up and login activities. 
Using this feature, important and/or personal messages can be kept safe from prying eyes. 
Messages can also be sent to any number using this application.

The project is developed using Android Studio 1.2.2, the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android platform development. 
The main aim of this project is to backup important messages to SQLite database of an android phone, with the security of appropriate 
sign-up and login activities.
